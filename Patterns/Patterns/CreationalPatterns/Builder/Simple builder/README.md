# Builder Pattern

The **Builder** pattern is a creational design pattern used for step-by-step construction of complex objects. Instead of constructing an object in a single, large constructor, it allows for incremental object creation.

## Why Use Builder?

Rather than passing numerous parameters to a constructor or creating multiple overloaded constructors, the **Builder** pattern helps by:
- Encapsulating the object creation process,
- Simplifying client code by hiding initialization complexity,
- Reducing dependency on specific implementation details.

## Directory Structure

The directories are organized as follows to reflect the core components of the **Builder** pattern:

- **AbstractBuilder/** – Contains the abstract class or interface defining the common steps for building an object.
- **ConcreteBuilder/** – Includes concrete implementations of the **Builder**, responsible for constructing different variations of the object.
- **Director/** – Manages the construction process by calling **Builder** methods in a specific order.
- **Product/** – Represents the final object that is being built using the **Builder**.

This structure improves code readability and maintainability by clearly separating responsibilities.
